If you want to import a file in the **ISO 20022 XML standard** and you do not have it available, you can create it using a special application
(converter) of the existing .csv file, which we provide for your convenience [here](https://www.nbg.gr/el/i-bank/sepa).
Otherwise, you will need to create the file according to the ISO 20022 XML standard, and specifically with CustomerCreditTransferInitiationV03 (pain.001.001.03).
Detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/myNBGcode/FileAPI_Cli_V4/blob/master/Documentation/Mass%20Transfers/SEPA_XML_Mass%20Credit%20File%20Format%20v1.0.PDF).

If the file you are going to import is in **CSV format**, you will need to create it with a spreadsheet editor such as MS Excel, select "save as" and "save as CSV type".
Detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/myNBGcode/FileAPI_Cli_V4/blob/master/Documentation/Mass%20Transfers/CSV_Mass%20Credit%20File%20Format%20v1.0.pdf).
